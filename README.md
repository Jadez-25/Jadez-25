# 👩🏽‍💻 Jada Cropper — Junior Software Developer

I'm passionate about building **secure and efficient systems** that simplify workflows and support real-world productivity. My core strength lies in **.NET development with C# and SQL Server**, and I’m expanding into **modern front-end technologies** like React and Firebase.
